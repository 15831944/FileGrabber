# End of Life (EOL) Notice
This program (FileGrabber) is no longer supported. The latest version is 0.3.0.

If you like our program, please notice **CSpy++**.

# Introduction for CSpy++
CSpy++ is under development currently. CSpy++ is several times larger and more complex than FileGrabber, and is also easier to use.

We plan that CSpy++ 0.0.1 will be released before Feburary 20, 2020. At least 3000 lines of code are typed at present. (FileGrabber 0.3.0 only has 2500+ lines!)

CSpy++ has features as below:

1. Easier config file. We use Json instead of XML this time! Json is much easier to read and process. We may develop a GUI for configuration if possible.

2. You can develop your own plug-in for the program. It can do anything for you if you are willing to!

3. Security improved. We will develop safer and more configurable API for use.

4. Auto-update. You no longer need to replace the program by your own. Eliminate the suspected risk fundamentally!

Our time table are below:
